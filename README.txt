Getting Started
---------------

basically I just run either

- /helloWorld.py
- /minimal.py

or in /backend:

- /backend/vue-page.py
- /backend/nuxt3-page.py

the last two will run through the install and build process, using npm and pnpm respectively, and hoist the files into a webpage at localhost:6543
It also has a basic skeleton of backend request from frontend that I'm working on right now but this is an excellent starter for anyone that's interested.

**It does use shell=True from subprocess but I wasn't able to run a node command system wide without it.**
